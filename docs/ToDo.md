Evaluation stars
Create the full mockup for all roles.
Upload main.tsx, index.css, App.tsx, App.css, AppShell.tsx, tailwind.config.js
Ask about index.css problem.

check own file deletion for designer and client.

Good job, my feedback:
1. Im not sure whats supposed to change after the IsOwn fix, take a look at the screenshot.
2. What benefit could stars on feedback add? is it meaningful? Should we leave a note or maybe a user story for sprint 5?
3. Should we allow the client to delete feedbacks in case they changed their mind? Should we allow all roles to delete their own messages?
4. Im new to this language, why did u add "Partial" to Fix 3? what does it? would omitting "Approval" not have been enough? Either way, it no longer allows me to update the status of Approval but it still shows "Pending" next to it.
5. As for the unread badges, its working but i noticed a small problem. If the user types a message, they will get the red badge while they are still on that tab. it will only dissapear if they click on another tab then go back to to messages tab for it to dissapear. My point is that in most apps who have this feature, if you are on that tab, it doesn't make sense for it to have that badge because its supposed to alert you. Fix this.

Note: if any change is a few lines of code, just tell me where to copy and paste. If it requires a lot of changes, then you can do it yourself.

In order to save tokens, you may only generate the document for S3 chapter.

1. Use this exact style:
```
A4 portrait, Times New Roman body text at 12 pt, justified, 1.5 line spacing, with about 6 pt paragraph spacing before and after.
Main chapter titles must be centered, bold, 16 pt, dark navy blue (#1F3864).
Section headings are left-aligned, bold, 14 pt, medium blue (#2E5496).
Subsections are left-aligned, bold, 12 pt, same blue as sections. Sub-subsections are the same except 11 pt.
Captions for figures and tables are centered, italic, 9 pt, dark navy (#0E2841), written as “Figure X: …” (Figure captions are under) or “Table X: …” (Table captions are above).
Tables must have full grid borders, dark blue header rows (#1F3864) with white bold centered text, 10 pt for column, row and body text.
Table rows must follow the following pattern: first row (#000000), second row (#F2F7FB) then repeat.
```
2. Preserve the textual use case table structure.
3. Keep spacing clean, avoid cramped layouts, and preserve the report’s formal academic look.
4. Keep it concise, avoid bloat, filler and repetitions.
5. Avoid AI-ish language, em dashes, semicolons and technical identifiers in prose.

Its important that you don't accidentally contradict or overwrite already existing files from past sprints. You can always pause and ask me to provide any files you require.
